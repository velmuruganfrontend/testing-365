<h2>Refund, Cancellation, and Subscription Policies</h2>


<p>All MyRx365 subscription plans for Doctors and Extenders include a 30-day free trial. A free trial cannot be paused or reinstated if the account is canceled before the initial trial period has ended.  
No refunds will be issued for any subscription payments made after the 30-day free trial period. Furthermore, MyRx365 does not offer prorated refunds for cancelled subscriptions. All subscriptions are recurring and will automatically renew after the end of each paid subscription period. This includes both month-to-month and annual plans. 
Similarly, it is your responsibility to evaluate MyRx365, including its features, limitations, and system requirements before selecting any Paid Plan. MyRx365 will not issue refunds to customers on the basis of customers not understanding the system requirements, or the presence of compatibility issues, including inadequate internet speed or consistency, or incompatible devices, operating systems, or browser software versions. System incompatibility based on system requirements should be tested during the 30 day free trial.</p> 

 
<h3>Fees, Refunds and Charges</h3>
<h4>Subscription Fees.</h4>
    <p>As a Doctor or Extender, you are responsible to pay all subscription fees and additional usage-based fees, and hereby authorize MyRx365 (and its payment processors) to debit the bank account or charge the credit card, as stated on your profile billing page. You agree that all subscriptions are recurring and will renew automatically. You shall also be solely responsible for paying and remitting to the appropriate tax authorities all applicable taxes (withholding tax, sales tax, services tax, value-added tax (VAT), goods and services tax (GST), etc.) or duties imposed by any government entity or collecting agency except those taxes based on MyRx365’s net income. In the event you fail to satisfy its tax and/or duty obligations herein, you shall reimburse MyRx365 upon demand for any taxes and/or duties paid on your behalf and shall defend, indemnify and hold MyRx365 harmless against any claim and/or liability (including penalties) resulting from a failure to pay such taxes and/or duties by you.</p>
 
<h3>Cancellation Policy.</h3>
    <p>As a Doctor or Extender using the MyRx365 platform, you acknowledge that all subscription fees are charged automatically on a recurring basis until you cancel the subscription (both month-to-month and annual plans). You may cancel the subscription by either canceling your account or by sending an email to support@telehealer.com. Once done, a confirmation email receipt is sent to you holder with the expiration date of the subscription. Please keep in mind that you are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. You must email support before or on the payment due date.</p> 

 
<h3>Refunds.</h3>
<p>All MyRx365 subscriptions include a 30-day free trial. After 30 days, the chosen plan is billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis and is non-refundable; no refunds will be issued. MyRx365 does not offer prorated refunds for cancelled subscription plans. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.
    All subscriptions, both month-to-month and annual plans, are recurring and will automatically renew after the end of each paid subscription period. </p>
 
    <h3>MyRx365’s Refund Policy for Annual Plans.</h3>
    <p>MyRx365 is committed to your success, but through experience we have found that users have varying requirements, capabilities, and limitations with regard to the types of devices, workflow processes, software they can use, the way their local network is configured, and/or the speed of their internet connection, etc.</p>
    <p>These issues may impact your ability to use MyRx365 as it is intended.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, MyRx365 offers a 30-day Free Trial to evaluate our software and its compatibility with your specific environment and workflows.</p>
<p>MyRx365 also offers a Month-to-Month Subscription Plan, which allows customers to upgrade, downgrade, and cancel at any time without penalty. We recommend this option for most customers, especially those that do not have full certainty or control over their devices, environment etc.</p>
<p>Finally, MyRx365 offers an Annual Subscription Plan at a significant discount. We recommend this plan for customers who are certain that MyRx365 is compatible with their workflow and environment. It is your responsibility to evaluate MyRx365, including its features, limitations, and system requirements before selecting the Annual Plan.</p>
<p>If you are not certain that MyRx365 is a fit for your use case and environment, then you should not choose the Annual Plan.</p>
    <p>MyRx365 will not issue refunds to Annual Plan customers on the basis of customers not understanding the system requirements, or the presence of compatibility issues, including inadequate internet speed or consistency, or incompatible devices, operating systems, browser software versions, or workflow issues.</p>
    <p>If you choose the Annual Plan, you are entering into a one-year subscription contract that expires 12 months after you sign up. You are responsible for paying the entire subscription. If you decide to cancel before the term of your subscription is up, then you will still be billed for the remaining months on your subscription, and will still have access to its benefits until it expires. </p>
 
    <h3>Third Party Charges.</h3>
    <p>You shall directly pay the fees and charges for all third party vendors whose services you use in connection with the platform (e.g., internet access providers, telephone carriers, etc.). In addition to any fees charged by MyRx365, MyRx365 reserves the right to charge you for any regulatory or governmental fees, contributions or other charges that are legally required or assessed.</p>
