To report any violation, please contact us at MyRx365, Inc. Attn: Legal, 4977 Roselle Cmn, Fremont, CA 94536</li></ul>

	   <li>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</li>
                           <ul><li>You agree to the following dispute resolution procedures for any claim or issue arising from or related to this Acceptable Use Policy. Both parties, you and us, agree to waive any right to a trial by jury in a court of general jurisdiction and any right to participate in a class action or consolidated action regarding a dispute as defined below. Specifically both parties, you and us, agree to waive any right to pursue a dispute by joining a disputed claim with the disputed claim of any other person or entity or to assert a disputed claim in a representative capacity on behalf of anyone else in any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding.</li>
                           <li>Instead, if the parties have a dispute, we agree to use due diligence and use our best efforts to work together to implement this Agreement and amicably resolve any differences. However, both of us understand that issues and conflicts may arise where we reach an impasse. We both acknowledge a desire to reach a working solution by using good faith attempts to resolve such issues and conflicts. Any claim or controversy related to or arising out of this Agreement, whether in contract or in tort (“Dispute”), will be resolved on a confidential basis, according to the following process, which either of us may start by delivering to the other a written notice describing the Dispute and the amount involved (“Demand”).</li>
                               <li>After receipt of a Demand, authorized representatives of both parties will meet at a mutually agreed upon time and place to try to resolve the Dispute by negotiation. If the Dispute remains unresolved 30 days after receipt of the Demand, either of us may start binding arbitration in Fremont, California. Both parties will use their best efforts to conclude the arbitration as expediently as possible but in no event later than 60 days following commencement of any proceeding, provided there is no interim relief or court action sought that would delay the parties from resolving the Dispute within such 60 day period. If such interim relief or court action is sought, then both parties will use their best efforts to conclude the arbitration within 60 days following the final decision of the court in such action. The arbitration will be before a three- arbitrator panel. Each party will select one partial arbitrator, in its sole discretion, to represent its interest at its sole expense. The partial arbitrator may be an employee, director, officer or principal of the party. The final arbitrator, who shall be impartial, will be selected by the two partial arbitrators. In the event the two partial arbitrators fail to select an impartial arbitrator, either of us may apply to a court of law to have a judge select an impartial arbitrator. The three arbitrators by majority ruling may adopt such procedures as they deem efficient and appropriate for making the determinations submitted to them for adjudication, and the parties agree that no court shall have the power to interfere with the proceedings and judgments of the arbitrators. No statements by, or communications between, the parties during negotiation or mediation, or both, will be admissible for any purpose in the arbitration or any other hearing. Each party shall bear its internal expenses and its attorney’s fees and expenses, and jointly share the cost of the impartial arbitrator. No interest shall be applied to any arbitration award. It is the intent of the parties to first allow the arbitrators an opportunity to meet and negotiate a decision. However, if an agreement cannot be reached through negotiation, then the decision(s) of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties.</li>
                               <li>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may resort to a court by applying for interim relief, with the requirement to post a bond or security, if such party reasonably determines that such relief is necessary because claims for money are not adequate to prevent irreparable injury to it or to a third party.</li></ul><br/>
<p>IN THE EVENT ANY OF THE PROVISIONS HEREIN ARE DEEMED UNENFORCEABLE OR VOID AS A MATTER OF LAW, BOTH PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS POLICY, OR THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY MYRX365.</p><br/>

                <li>CHANGES</li>
                <ul><li>We may change this Acceptable Use Policy from time to time, so it is important that you frequently check this policy on our website to verify what, if any, changes have been made. You expressly agree that your continued use of our website or Services shall be deemed conclusive evidence of your acceptance of any such new or modified terms.</li></ul>

	<li>APPLICABLE LAW</li>	
                <ul><li>This Policy and your use of our Services shall be subject to and governed by (a) the laws of the State of California, without regard to any conflicts of law provisions therein, and (b) any applicable federal laws including, but not limited to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. In the event of an inconsistency between any governmental requirement and these Terms regarding the provision of a Service that is subject to the governmental requirement, the governmental requirement will apply to the extent necessary to avoid the inconsistency.</li></ul></ul>
