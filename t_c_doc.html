            <p>We may suspend or terminate, in whole or in part, your access to the Site or Services if you violate the terms and conditions set forth in this Section.</p>
			<p><b>Fees and Payment Terms.</b></p>
			<p>You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable except as otherwise specified herein, (i) fees are tiered and based on usage of the platform, (ii) payment obligations are non- cancelable and fees paid are non-refundable, and (iii) platform usage cannot be decreased during the relevant term. </p>
			<p>You will provide us with valid and updated credit card information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative document reasonably acceptable to us. By providing MyRx365 with your credit card number or PayPal account and associated payment information, you agree that MyRx365 is authorized to invoice your account for all fees and charges due and payable to MyRx365 based on the usage of then platform and that no additional notice or consent is required. Unless otherwise stated, invoiced charges are due net 30 days from the invoice date.  We shall charge your payment card on file within 30 days of using the Services. If the credit card payment method gets rejected or should we not have one on file, we may charge you any associated processing fees in addition to the amount owed.  You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to us and notifying us of any changes to such information. </p>
			<p><b>Overdue Charges</b></p>
			<p>If any invoiced amount is not received by us by the due date, then without limiting our rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, and/or (b) we may condition future usage on payment terms shorter than those specified above. </p>
			<p><b>Taxes.</b></p>
			<p>Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “<b>Taxes</b>”). You are responsible for paying all taxes associated with your purchases hereunder. If we have the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible , we will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, we are solely responsible for taxes assessable against us based on our income, property and employees. </p>
			<p><b>Future Functionality.</b></p>
			<p>You agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by us regarding future functionality or features. </p>
			<p><b>Free Trial Period.</b></p>
			<p>MyRx365 may, in its sole discretion, offer, during the registration process, a one-time free trial period during which you can try out platform for 30 days from the date you register without paying any fees ("<b>Free Trial Period</b>").</p>
			<p>If you participate in a Free Trial Period, you must stop using the platform by the end of the Free Trial Period to avoid incurring any charges. If you do not cancel or stop using the platform before the Free Trial Period expires, you authorize us to charge your credit card the full cost of your Plan, as described on our webpage <a href="https://MyRx365.com/product/doctors/#pricing" target="_blank"> https://MyRx365.com/product/doctors/#pricing</a>. Your Plan will then automatically renew and continue month-to-month on a pay-as-you-go basis, unless and until you stop using Services or we terminate it. You may not receive a notice from MyRx365 that your Free Trial Period is about to end or has ended.</p>
			<p>You may terminate your participation at any time during the Free Trial Period. Upon terminating your account, you will immediately lose all access to the platform and any data or information stored within your account.</p>
			<p>MyRx365 reserves the right to modify, cancel and/or limit the Free Trial Period offer at any time.</p>
